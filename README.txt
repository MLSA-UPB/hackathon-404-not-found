# Simple equation solver with tkinter

This simple piece of software is basically a digit and mathematical symbol classifier, all these put together in order to solve basic operations.

## Datasets

[mnist](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) dataset

part of [crohme] dataset(+  -  x)


## How to use
Run the notebook App.ipynb. You will need the models generated by ModelForDigits.ipynb and ModelForSymbols.ipynb. 3 Windows will pop off, each one promted with it's role(one for first term, one for second term and one for the operation). 

In each window you have the option to predict or to clear. Predict button will show off computer's prediction regarding your drawing and it's accuracy. Clear will just clear the canvas. After all windows are closed just run last block of code to get your result
